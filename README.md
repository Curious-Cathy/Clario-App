# 📱 Clario – Flutter Utility App

Clario is a **Flutter-based utility services application** developed to **learn and practice core Flutter concepts through real-world features**.

This app simulates common daily utility services like **electricity, water, gas, broadband, telecom, education, insurance, and payments**, helping understand Flutter development by building practical screens instead of simple demos.

It serves as a **hands-on learning project** and a **Flutter experimentation lab**.
